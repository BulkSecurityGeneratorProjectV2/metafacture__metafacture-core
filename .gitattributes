# Explicitly declare text files we want to always be normalized:
*.java text diff=java
*.xml text
*.xsd text
*.flux text
*.g text
*.properties text
*.pica text
*.txt text
*.js text
*.fom text

# Platform-specific scripts should always use
# their native end-of-line markers:
*.bat text eol=crlf
*.sh text eol=lf

# The batch script can only handle the config
# properly if it uses crlf as end-of-line marker:
metafacture-runner/src/main/dist/config/java-options.conf text eol=crlf

# Denote all files that are truly binary and should not be modified:
*.bz2 binary
*.bzip2 binary
*.gz binary
*.gzip binary
*.xz binary
